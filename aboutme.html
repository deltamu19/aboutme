	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a network administrator and have been in the IT industry for about five years. Recently, I haven't been very happy with my career. While trying to find a possible new adventure, a friend suggested to try learning HTML and CSS and see where it takes me. I decided to take that advice and dive right in taking free courses from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>, <a href="http://www.sololearn.com/">Solo Learn</a>, and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. After much deliberating, I eventually decided to continue learning through Thinkful's <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/courses/web-development-career-path/">Web Development Career Path</a>.

	<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
	<p>I'm originally from Philippines, born and raised. My family moved to Los Angeles, CA when I was about twelve years old and have been in the LA area ever since. As much as I love living in California with the great weather, beaches, and - most importantly - food, I have come to love Seattle after several visits and am planning on moving, hopefully before the end of this year.</p>

	<h1>More About Me</h1>
	
	<h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
	<p>I love trying out new things so every so often I have a new hobby I'm obsessed with. But what has stuck for a while and am still doing are archery, playing the drums, reading (whether it be a novel, comics, or graphic novels - I'd read them all), building LEGOs, and tinkering/building computers.</p>
	
	<h3>What are your favorite TV shows?</h3>
	<p>I love TV shows - I should've added that as my hobby - so this will be a long one. I love reading comics so naturally, some of my favorite shows are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)">Jessica Jones</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)">Daredevil</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flash_(2014_TV_series)">The Flash</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(TV_series)">Arrow</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergirl_(TV_series)">Supergirl</a>.</p> 
	<p>I'm also a big fan of comedies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_(TV_series)">Chuck</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crazy_Ones">The Crazy Ones</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_None">Master of None</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Off_Ted">Better Off Ted</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Burgers">Bob's Burgers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Off_the_Boat">Fresh off the Boat</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation">Parks and Recreation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_the_Worst">You're the Worst</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbreakable_Kimmy_Schmidt">Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</a>.</p> 
	<p>I recently got into anime and have been watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter_(2011)_episodes">Hunter x Hunter</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_(anime)">Full Metal Alchemist</a>. Last but certainly not the least, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race">RuPaul's Drag Race</a>. This is the only reality show I can watch. The rest of them, even if I tried, I wouldn't even be able to tolerate sitting through an episode. I actually have an idea for a web application based on this show that I'm hoping I would be able to bring into fruition after finishing my web development course from <a href="https://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
	<p>My dream job is to head my own software development company and be able to work with my own team of creative engineers. There are still a lot of steps to get to that point so for now I would say to be a great web developer.</p>
	
	<h3>What music have you been listening to?</h3>
	<p>Lately, I find myself listening to <a href="http://home.runrivernorth.com/">Run River North</a>, <a href="http://blackrebelmotorcycleclub.com/">Black Rebel Motorcycle Club</a>, <a href="http://florenceandthemachine.net/">Florence and the Machine</a>,
    <a href="http://falloutboy.com/">Fall Out Boy</a>, and <a href="http://waitress.sarabmusic.com/">Sara Barailles</a>.</p>
